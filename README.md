# Airbnb-Booking-Analysis

## Introduction :

Airbnb began in 2008 when two designers who had space to share hosted three travelers looking for a place to stay. Now, millions of hosts and travelers choose to create a free Airbnb account so they can list their space and book unique accommodations anywhere in the world. And Airbnb experience hosts share their passions and interests with both travelers and locals. Airbnb helps make sharing easy, enjoyable, and safe. We verify personal profiles and listings, maintain a smart messaging system so hosts and guests can communicate with certainty, and manage a trusted platform to collect and transfer payments.

## Objectives :

Data Prepping/Wrangling.

Checking the Null values for cleaning the Dataset for further analysis.

Checking the unique values for Analyzing the Dataset for further analysis

Exploration of Neighborhood group, Neighborhood, Room type, Price, Reviews.

Correlation between variables.

Analysis of V hosts and key findings.

## Approach :

In this EDA, an analysis is done on a dataset which helps us to visualize the different factors in data which help us to conclude the different insights, predictions of the data, 
In this project I have 1st clean the data, make the data as much as we can utilize each factor to its maximum limit, then I have done the EDA to obtain the perception from the given data.

## Data prepping

The dataset contains Airbnb Booking with respect to the factors associated with it from 2008 to 2022. In which there are total 16 variables having 48895 observations in which there are 3 categorical variables and the rest of numerical variables. In this dataset the observations represent the features of hotel booking, with respect to availability of resources such as price, neighborhood, neighborhood type, type of room available, reviews of that particular room.  
As the dataset is real business data, it can be used for scientific and educational purposes and many other fields. 


## Challenges Faced

Size: The size of the dataset right away is the strength as well as the most challenging aspect of this dataset. Although there are 16 fields that describe every factor, itâ€™s only natural that such a wide range of information may not be available for every property This results in a large number of missing or 0 values. 


NaN values: NaN values in the dataset had to be cleaned up accordingly. For instance, NaN values in Numerical and categorical fields like last_review, reviews_per_month and name, host_name were replaced with unknown and not_known respectively. 

## Conclusion :

In this project, we are analyzing the various aspects with different use cases which covers many
aspects of Airbnb listings. It helps in not only understanding the meaningful relationships between
attributes but it also allows us to do our own research and come-up with our findings. The objective
of the project is to perform an exploratory data analysis, data pre-processing, data cleaning &
imputation and at the end, apply different Data Visualization techniques to get the meaningful insight
room the given data.

From the given Dataset, there are 3 unique room type and 5 neighborhood group ranking followed
by Entire Apartment> Private Room > Shared Room and for neighborhood group ranking followed
Manhattan at the top and Staten Island at bottom Neighborhood.

Sonder (NYC) has the highest number or properties in given data.
Williamsburg has the highest properties of Brooklyn neighborhood group and also Brooklyn has a
greater number of Private Rooms unlike Manhattan has entire apartment.

Also, the price of Manhattan is most expensive unlike shared room is least expensive one.
From the analysis we can say that people are preferring entire home/apt over private which are
present in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and people preferring listing which are less in price.

In this analysis project, about sixteen different use cases are analyzed for the given dataset make
better business decisions and help analyze customer trends and satisfaction, which can lead to new
and better products and services. It has been found that Most of the Bookings were takes place
form the Manhattan followed by Brooklyn, queens, Bronx and Staten Island respectively.
